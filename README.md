# ft_printf

This is my own version of a printf function. It is only the mandatroy part, therefore it does NOT handle flags.
The function prints strings and DOES handle the following conversions: %s %i %c %x %X %u %d %p %%.

Furthermore the subject gives an introduction into the work with variadic functions.
